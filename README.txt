NOTE: There is something in the SAP Wireshark code that runs that cannot accept spaces in the path. This means there cannot be spaces in the path to where you desire to install Wireshark.
1 - Extract or download contents into the desired folder you would like the Wireshark build installed to.
2 - Run PowerShell as administrator and move to the folder containing the extracted contents.
3 - Run the SAP_Wireshark.ps1 script.
4 - The script will restart the computer.
5 - When the computer restarts repeat steps 2 and 3.
